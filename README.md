# bigInteger
As it is known C language has limit for integer numbers max value is 2147483647 and min value is -2147483647. For making calculations with bigger numbers or less numbers than these limits we can use data structures. In this project i used double linked list to keep number and i provide multiplication, addition and subrtraction operations for them.

For running the code you should give input.txt as a parameter. In this input file you can write integers with maximum 50 digit and you can write 4 different operations as maximum. For example 123 * 123 * 123 - 123 + 123, in this example we have 4 different operations. Then it code will create a output.txt file which contains the answer of calculation.
